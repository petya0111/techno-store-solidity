## Execute tasks for local setup

Install the dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

Compile the contracts
```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

Run tests with 100% coverage. Unit tests are typically run on hardhat networks or ganache.
```shell
npm run test
```

Run tests coverage. 
```shell
npm run coverage
```

#### Create .env file with keys from .env.example. By default network is goerli.

Deploying on testnet goerli network
```shell
npx hardhat deploy-testnets --network goerli
```

You challenge is to create the following smart contract:
## Your Contract

Using Remix/Hardhat develop a contract for a TechnoLime Store.

- The administrator (owner) of the store should be able to add new products and the quantity of them.
- The administrator should not be able to add the same product twice, just quantity.
- Buyers (clients) should be able to see the available products and buy them by their id.
- Buyers should be able to return products if they are not satisfied (within a certain period in blocktime: 100 blocks).
- A client cannot buy the same product more than one time.
- The clients should not be able to buy a product more times than the quantity in the store unless a product is returned or added by the administrator (owner)
- Everyone should be able to see the addresses of all clients that have ever bought a given product.
